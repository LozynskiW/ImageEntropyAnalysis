# What do files here do

## execute_script.py

This is a script that You should import to Blender3d
and execute. This script will take all trajectories 
one by one, select some object and execute commands from
trajectory, which will mostly just place object in space,
render and save image.

Trajectories/objects/paths are all defined in file.
